      <h2>I'm building a site that makes finding tea shops and caf√©'s easier for all the tea lovers out there.</h2>
<h3>Because of my gluttinous love of tea and all derivatives of it...I'm looking at you matcha ice cream! I thought this would be a perfect way of re-enforcing what I'm learning in my coding bootcamp. </h3>
<h4>By appying what I've learned to something I could actually see myself using, my technical and creative senses are more than excited to see where this project goes. </h4>
