## Description

I'm building a site that makes finding tea shops and caf√©'s easier for all the tea lovers out there. Because of my gluttinous love of tea and all derivatives of it...I'm looking at you matcha ice cream! I thought this would be a perfect way of re-enforcing what I'm learning in my coding bootcamp.By appying what I've learned to something I could actually see myself using, my technical and creative senses are more than excited to see where this project goes.

## Work In Progress

I am currently working on this alongside being a full-time bootcamp student, so prioritizing time is of upmost importance.
With that being said, I will update Tea Time as often as I can.
